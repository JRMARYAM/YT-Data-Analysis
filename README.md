I have built an end-to-end ETL pipeline to process YouTube trending video data using PySpark in Databricks Community Edition. I ingested CSV and JSON files, performed data cleaning and joins, computed engagement metrics using UDFs, and saved the processed data. I also visualized insights like top-performing categories and engagement rates. This project shows my ability to work with Spark, SQL, transformations, and big data workflows
